Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer: ***
The term "software engineering" was first introduced during the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference was pivotal in formally recognizing software development as a distinct field that required systematic methods similar to those used in traditional engineering disciplines.

Another significant milestone was the introduction of the Waterfall Model in 1970 by Winston W. Royce. This model established a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each phase—requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance—was completed before moving on to the next. It provided a structured methodology for managing software projects.

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto revolutionized software development by promoting iterative progress, flexibility, and collaboration. This shift from rigid, sequential processes to adaptive and responsive practices led to the creation of frameworks like Scrum and Kanban, which are now widely used in the industry.
***


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer: ***
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) typically consists of the following phases:

1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis: This phase involves collecting and documenting the requirements of the software from stakeholders. The goal is to understand what the software needs to do and to outline its features and functionalities.
2. Design: In this phase, the system’s architecture and design are created based on the requirements. This includes defining the overall structure, components, interfaces, and data flow.
3. Implementation (or Coding): During this phase, the actual code is written according to the design specifications. Developers create the software’s functionality by translating design documents into a working codebase.
4. Testing: This phase involves rigorously testing the software to identify and fix any defects or issues. Various types of testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, system testing) ensure that the software works as intended and meets the specified requirements.
5. Deployment: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to the production environment where it becomes available to end-users. This phase may include installation, configuration, and initial user training.
6. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated and modified to fix bugs, improve performance, or adapt to new requirements. This phase ensures the software continues to function correctly and remain relevant over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer: ***
The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase—requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance—must be completed before moving on to the next. It is well-suited for projects with clear, stable requirements and where extensive documentation and adherence to predefined standards are crucial, such as in regulated industries or compliance-driven applications. However, its rigid structure makes it less adaptable to changes, and late testing can lead to discovering issues only after the project is well underway.

In contrast, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that breaks the project into smaller, manageable chunks or sprints, allowing for regular reassessment and adaptation of requirements based on ongoing feedback. This methodology is ideal for dynamic projects where requirements are expected to evolve or are not fully understood at the start, such as in startups developing innovative products or in rapidly changing technology environments. Agile emphasizes collaboration and customer feedback, providing a more adaptable and responsive development process compared to the more rigid Waterfall model.
